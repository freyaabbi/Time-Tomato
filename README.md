The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves working on a task for 25 minutes, then taking a five-minute break, and repeating the process four times. 
This technique can be effectively utilized in various scenarios to improve productivity and time management. Here are five uses of the Pomodoro Timer technique:
